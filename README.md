This is a school project to recreate an oil painting in minecraft.

It just needs some touching up and a better screen-shot.

We're using Eihort as the utility to make a screenshot:

Any help would be appreciated, as we're sort of stuck right now - colors are off, not much detail, and our screenshots aren't in the right perspective.
